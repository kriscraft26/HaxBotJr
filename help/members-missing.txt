Snapshot=
Before each bi-weekly reset, a snapshot is taken for every commands that supports snapshot, and their result is preserved as a snapshot.
Those commands all have a `[-s|--snap KEY]` argument, which is used to access its snapshots by specify a key.
A key can be in 3 forms:

__index__: this is a number that specify a bi-week relative to current bi-week. 
For example `-s 1` will access the snapshot of previous bi-week, and `-s 2` is the bi-week before that, and so on.
__date__: this will access the snapshot of the bi-week which the date is contained in, the date need to be in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD`.
For example `-s 2020/10/14` will access the snapshot of bi-week of 2020/10/11 - 2020/10/24.
__bi-week__: this will access the snapshot of that bi-week, it need to be in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD-YYYY/MM/DD`, with the left side as the first day of bi-week, and right side as the last day.
For example `-s 2020/10/11-2020/10/24` will access the snapshot of that bi-week.
