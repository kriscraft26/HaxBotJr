Display list of guild members. By using the `[-i|--idle]` flag, the list filtered and only displays idle members.


Membership=

1. have a rank role (Cosmonaut, MoonWalker, Cadet...)
2. Nickname in the format of "ROLE IGN"
2. The role part of the nickname must be the same as their rank role ("Rocketeer Pucaet"), or is a registered visual role ("Top Gunner Pucaet").
Registered visual roles can be displayed and modified through `config vrole`.
A user that is part of `user.ignore` will never be recognized. `user.ignore` can be displayed and modified through `config user ignore`


Idle Members=
A guild member is considered as idle if their ign (as specified by their nick) is not in the in-game guild.
Once a guild member is marked as idle, their stats won't be updated.


Snapshot=
Before each bi-weekly reset, a snapshot is taken for every commands that supports snapshot, and their result is preserved as a snapshot.
Those commands all have a `[-s|--snap KEY]` argument, which is used to access its snapshots by specify a key.
A key can be in 3 forms:

__index__: this is a number that specify a bi-week relative to current bi-week. 
For example `-s 1` will access the snapshot of previous bi-week, and `-s 2` is the bi-week before that, and so on.
__date__: this will access the snapshot of the bi-week which the date is contained in, the date need to be in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD`.
For example `-s 2020/10/14` will access the snapshot of bi-week of 2020/10/11 - 2020/10/24.
__bi-week__: this will access the snapshot of that bi-week, it need to be in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD-YYYY/MM/DD`, with the left side as the first day of bi-week, and right side as the last day.
For example `-s 2020/10/11-2020/10/24` will access the snapshot of that bi-week.
