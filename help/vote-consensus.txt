`vote consensus <title>`

Start a consensus vote. Assent is the default vote.
If there title contains space, wrap it with `"`, for example `"vote title"` instead of `vote title`.


Vote Types=
__Assent__: Agree on the proposal.
__Reserve__: Disagree on the proposal but willing to let it pass.
__Dissent__: Disagree on the proposal.
__Object__: STRONGLY disagree on the proposal, that can't be compromised.
__Stand aside__: neutral vote, this vote should be casted if you feel that you are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal.


Object is not Veto=
The ethics of consensus decision-making encourage expeditioners to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences, 
so cast object vote thoughtfully and justified!


Results and Conditions=
__Pass__: 0 - 1 Object and 0 Dissent
__Failed__: 1 or more Dissent
__Rejected__: 2 or more Object


Examples=
`vote consensus "this is a vote"`
`vote consensus vote!!!`
