`vote options <title> [options ...] [-d|--default DEFAULT] [-t|--target TARGET]`

Start a vote on list of options.

If there is a space in an option or title, wrap it with `"`, for example `"apple pie"` instead of `apple pie`.


Default=
If default is specified, it will be all expeditioner's vote until they have explicitly voted.


Target=
If target is specified, the vote will automatically end when any option reached that percentage of vote.
For example with target of 50, when any option reached 50% of the explicit global votes, the vote is ended and result is displayed anonymously.


Examples=
`vote options "this is a vote" apple banana`
`vote options vote!!! apple banana -d apple`
`vote options owo apple banana --default apple -t 50`
